### Question 1  

*Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?* 

I knew from a young age that I wanted to spend my life helping people, and I excelled primarily in my math and science classes growing up. So when I needed to declare a major at only 20 years old, it seemed natural to choose math with the pathway of becoming a teacher.  My mom was a teacher, and my dad owned a small local campground business so I unfortunately was not exposed to the technology or engineering types of fields to know what kinds of career opportunities came from them. As a teenager, I did help my dad build his company website by teaching myself basic HTML just by doing Google searches.  While there were a few online companies that offered website templates in the early 2000’s, I was intrigued by the idea that I could build it myself from scratch. I spent a summer on the website and enjoyed learning the basics of coding. My brother took over the business after my dad passed away and chose to hire a company to make the website look more professional, so the website I made no longer exists unfortunately. This was my primary exposure to the computer programming fields, and I imagined a career like this would look like people sitting in offices working on computers all day to make and run websites for companies. This vision didn’t align well with my primary goal of choosing a career to help people. I realize now how every single organization in the world needs some sort of support that comes from computer programming. Beyond that, there have been so many software applications developed for the purpose of helping disenfranchised groups of people through education, finances, communication, and probably so many other ways that I am not aware of.  However, I still see a large focus in technology that is meant to benefit large companies or people who can afford smart phones and drones and whatever other new obsessions pop up. I want to become a programmer to find ways to help the “unprofitable” groups of people that are overlooked.
